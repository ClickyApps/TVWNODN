There is another WRVS shop in the main entrance with a larger variety of snacks, drinks, newspapers, books and magazines, as well as basic toiletries.

                <p>
                    The nearest railway station is in Winchester City, approximately 0.7 miles away. This is a very walkable distance, however, it is worth noting that the road into the city is on a fairly steep hill, and so people with mobility limitations may find it difficult.

                <h3 class="first">Visiting information</h3>
                <p><strong>Parents</strong><br>
                    Parents are welcome on the unit at any time and are encouraged to participate fully in their baby’s care. Other visitors are welcomed between 2pm and 3pm and then between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. Children under 16 (other than siblings) are not allowed. Under special circumstances, visitors may be allowed at other times, but this would need to be discussed and agreed in advance with the Sister in charge.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Number of visitors</strong><br>
                    Due to space restrictions, we ask families to limit visiting to 2 per family at any one time. One of these should be a parent. Visitors can be rotated during the visiting hours.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings</strong><br>
                    Siblings are welcome to visit with their parents. It is requested that very young children are closely supervised
                </p>
                <p><strong>Restrictions</strong><br>
                    All visiting is at the discretion of the Sister in charge. At busy times, numbers of visitors may need to be restricted and in the event of an emergency, visitors may be respectfully asked to leave. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hygiene and infection prevention</strong><br>
                    Prevention of infection is treated with the highest priority. A wash hand basin is available just outside the main doors to the Neonatal Unit. We ask that visitors wash and gel their hands here, then again when they enter the nurseries. Outdoor coats should be removed on entering the Neonatal Unit and hung on the hooks provided.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Family and friends</strong><br>
                    Although it is very natural for family and friends to wish to visit the Neonatal Unit, they are respectfully reminded that the babies are here because they are very small and/or sick and need to be in a quiet and controlled environment. Loud conversations can be very distressing for a preterm baby.
                </p>

            <div id="tab4" class="tabContent ward">
                <h3 class="first">Neonatal unit facilities</h3>
                <p><strong>Parent accommodation</strong><br>
                    There are two en-suite parents’ double bedrooms available on the Neonatal Unit. They are used for parents to room in with their baby just prior to discharge. There are other criteria for the use of these rooms which can be discussed with the nursing staff when the need arises.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent facilities</strong><br>
                    The family room is also for the use of parents where they can enjoy a few minutes of “time out”, make a cup of tea or coffee and have a chat with other parents. There is a microwave if parents wish to bring meals from home to heat up. The sofas in the coffee room are very comfortable and there is also a TV.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent support group</strong><br>
                    There is a parent support group which was devised by the mothers of two former Neonatal Unit babies. This is called Hope’s Butterfly <a href="#" onclick="var ref = window.open('http://www.hopesbutterfly.moonfruit.com/', '_system'); return false;">http://www.hopesbutterfly.moonfruit.com/</a> . There is also a Facebook page for Hope’s Butterfly.<br>
                    Further support can be obtained from organisations such as the National Childbirth Trust or specific organisations such as TAMBA (multiple births). Nursing staff will advise on appropriate support.

                </p>
                <p><strong>Facilities for siblings</strong><br>
                    The Neonatal Unit is lucky to have a large family room available with a range of toys for siblings. Children should not be left unsupervised in the family room and parents are respectfully asked to leave the room tidy.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Mobile phone use</strong><br>
                    Mobile phone, laptop and tablet use should be kept to an absolute minimum/emergency use when in the nurseries. Whilst in the nurseries, please ensure that your phone is set to “airplane mode” which will allow camera use. If a phone call must be taken, then this can be done in the family room.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Bereavement support</strong><br>
                    Losing a baby is an extremely traumatic event for everyone involved. Families will be given a private space and time to spend with their baby if this is desired. Nursing staff are trained to provide emotional support and the trust also employs a Bereavement officer to advise on the practical issues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Literature and contact information for useful organisations such as SANDS and the Child Bereavement Trust will also be provided.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Telephone and computer access</strong><br>
                    The direct line for the Neonatal Unit is 01962 824200.

                </p>
                <p><strong>Counselling</strong><br>
                    Having a baby on the Neonatal Unit can be an exceptionally stressful time for families. Many parents find support by talking amongst themselves on the Unit and nursing staff are also always on hand to provide a listening ear. Please see the section on Hope’s Butterfly. If any families are having particular difficulties, then staff would be happy to refer them to an appropriate source of support. This may be the PALS service, the chaplaincy or even for some practical advice on which benefits they may be entitled to and how to claim them. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breastfeeding facilities and support</strong><br>
                    Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust have now achieved BFI accreditation http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly  having successfully passed all 3 stages. Support for breastfeeding is readily available on the Neonatal Unit and staff are proud of the number of mums who go home successfully breastfeeding their baby. Literature and contact numbers for other support groups are also widely available. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the unit, privacy is protected by the use of screens and a separate room is available for expressing breast milk. Mums are encouraged to express milk at a very early stage.
                </p>


                <h3>Who's who on the unit?</h3>
                <p><strong>Clinical Lead</strong><br>
                    The Clinical Lead on the Neonatal unit is Grazia Sinar. Grazia would be happy to talk to any parent regarding the care of their baby. The nursing staff would be able to make an appointment, or parents would be welcome to approach Grazia as she is frequently around on the unit.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Play specialists</strong><br><br>
                    Most babies are home with their families before play becomes appropriate, however, several nursery nurses are employed on the unit who are skilled in the entertainment of the older babies! Parents are encouraged to bring in mobiles, musical toys etc for stimulation. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Family centred care/developmental care lead</strong><br>
                    All staff are trained in the developmental care of preterm babies, which begins as soon as the baby is admitted with the use of incubator covers and positioning aids. Parents are shown how to “incubator cuddle” and how to participate in their baby’s care. Further information regarding developmental care can be obtained from Sister Morag Gourlay, who has a special interest in the subject. Siblings are included where possible and made to feel part of the new extended family unit. Parents are welcome to be present during ward rounds to receive a full update on their baby’s progress and contribute to the care planning process. An individual appointment with their Consultant may also be arranged on request. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nurse manager</strong><br>
                    Mary Fitzmaurice is an Advanced Neonatal Nurse Practitioner who works closely with the medical team ensuring the best quality of care. She also acts as a senior ward manager and can be approached to discuss any concerns. Sandie Skinner is also a senior ward manager and her role is as a Consultant Nurse
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Neonatal Unit has three ward managers/sisters Carolyn Wilson, Raewyn Twaddle and Judy Simpson. There is generally a ward manager on duty with whom to discuss any issues and they are always happy to do so. In the event that they are not on duty, there is always a deputy sister on duty.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Other important staff</strong><br>
                    Caring for preterm and sick babies involves a large team of professionals all working together to achieve the best possible outcomes. Mr Luke Clifford provides eye screening (retinopathy of prematurity) , physiotherapists, Ali Palmer, Lynsey Cleveland and Paula Leake provide valuable input and there are regular visits from pharmacists Nichola Jones and Josh McKie. Other visiting professionals include radiographers, dieticians and midwives.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breastfeeding advisor</strong><br>
                    All the staff on the Neonatal Unit are skilled in assisting mothers to successfully establish breast feeding and will teach mothers according to the principles of the Baby Friendly Initiative. This means that advice given by midwives on the labour ward/Geoffrey Hammond ward and offered on the Neonatal unit should be consistent. Contact numbers for other breastfeeding support groups is also available. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>What to expect when you arrive</h3>

                    The Neonatal Unit at the RHCH is situated on the lower ground floor of Florence Portal House. There is access to this floor by lift or by stairs. On reaching the front door of the Neonatal Unit, visitors are requested to wash and gel their hands and then ring the doorbell. They will be asked to identify themselves before admission is granted. We respectfully ask that visitors allow a few minutes for staff to respond as the unit may be very busy.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Talking to the medical team</strong><br>
                    The medical staff are happy to talk to parents either during or after the ward round, or at a prearranged appointment.

                <p><strong>Baby rest time</strong><br>
                    Babies need lots of quiet, undisturbed sleep, so minimal handling is practised as far as possible. Nursing staff, in addition, try to set aside an hour in the afternoon 1pm-2pm where the baby is not disturbed unless absolutely necessary.
