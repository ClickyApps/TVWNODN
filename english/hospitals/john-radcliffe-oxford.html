                Please wash your hands and hang up outside coats on entering the unit. Lockers are available for valuables. Please wash your hands prior to touching your baby. Hand washing is very important to protect your baby and the other babies on the unit. It is imperative that you use the hand gel located by the entrance of the nurseries when entering and leaving the unit. All outdoor clothing must be removed and placed on the coat hooks provided. Coin operated lockers are available at the nurseries entrance. They are operated using a £1 coin which is given back when you return the key. We also ask you to remove all jewellery including your watch since they carry a lot of bacteria and are difficult to wash. You also need to roll your sleeves to the elbows and then thoroughly wash your hands, wrists and forearms. After, reapply hand gel. Remember to always wash your hands before and after touching your baby. Food is not permitted inside the nurseries but can be eaten in the parent’s room. Hot drinks are allowed but extra care must be taken to prevent accidents. Therefore, they should be kept away from the cot and baby.</p>

                <p>They provide support through the funding of two family support workers who offer emotional and practical support on the unit day to day. They are also trained at assessing families who will need additional help in caring for their baby. 
                </p>
                <p>They coordinate a Parent Help Volunteer group who visit parents and families with a baby in the NCU. All the volunteers have had an experience in the NCU and they offer a listening ear. They make visits to the maternity wards and the NCU on Monday evenings and Thursday mornings.
