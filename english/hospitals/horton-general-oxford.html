                <p><strong>Other important stuff</strong><br>
                    The Horton SCBU is connected with 5 other neonatal unit (Milton Keynes, oxford, Aylesbury, reading and slough) known jointly as the ‘Thames valley neonatal network’. We aim to care for all the babies from our area requiring neonatal care, however not all babies need the same amount of care. Within the network Banbury is a level one unit, caring for sick babies and babies greater than 34 weeks gestation. Milton Keynes, Aylesbury, reading and slough are level 2 units, providing some breathing support and more specialised care for early and sick babies. Oxford is a level 3 unit and gives intensive care, including caring for babies with specialised problems requiring surgery and or cardiology input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the staff in each neonatal unit are qualified and experienced in giving the level of care that unit provides so you can be confident of the best care for your baby at whichever level of nursery your baby is being cared for.

                <p><strong>Talking to the medical team</strong><br>
                    The doctors and nurses caring for your baby want you to be involved and informed in every aspect of your baby’s care and time on the unit. We will talk to you whenever you come to visit your baby and update you about their care and progress. If we need to contact you when you are not visiting, then we will contact you by phone, please ensure you have given us your correct and most current contact details.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Who to talk to about your baby’s care</strong><br>
                    Each day there will be a nurse allocated to care for your baby. There are always doctors on the unit who you can ask any questions to.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Ward round</strong><br>
                    There is a daily ward round which is led by the consultant and doctors, during this they will discuss your baby’s progress and any changes that will be made to the care of your baby. You are welcome to be on the unit when this is happening.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Who to talk to if you have any concerns</strong><br>
