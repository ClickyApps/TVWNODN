                <ul>
                    <li>The RBH Chapel is open and lit during the day and night and for many people is a place of prayer and quiet. (The Chapel is shut after 10.00pm for security reasons.) The space is deeply rooted in the history of the hospital from a Christian perspective. It is located just inside the London Road entrance to the hospital in North Block.</li>
                    <li>The Sanctuary is designed to be used by people of all faiths or none and for this reason there are no religious symbols. It is a hope that people will find this space a haven of peace for quiet reflection and contemplation. It can be found on Level 2 in the Concourse in Centre Block a short distance down the corridor to the left of the ‘Welcome Desk’. Roman Catholic Mass is celebrated here at 11am on Wednesday. Muslim prayers are held here on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 1.00-2.00pm and on Friday between 12.30-2.15pm.</li>
                    <li>The Peace Garden is located just below the Sanctuary on Level 1 in Centre Block and can be accessed off the corridor on Level 1 opposite the Clinical Decision Unit (CDU). There are features and plants to help relax the mind and engage the imagination.</li>

                <h3 class="first">By car</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are travelling to the hospital by car, the main car park (multi storey) is located on Craven Road.
                </p>
                <p>Parking for patients and visitors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital is on levels 0, 1, 2 and 3 of the multi-storey car park in Craven Road.</p>
                <p>From the multi-storey you can easily get to main reception on level 2 of the Main Entrance Block.</p>
                <p>There are also a small number of parking spaces:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>outside North Block (the old entrance on London Road)</li>
                    <li>on West Drive (off Redlands Road)</li> 
                    <li>outside Endoscopy on Craven Road</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Parking is free for disabled badge holders and there are designated parking spaces for disabled visitors on Levels 0 and 2 of the multi-storey; outside North Block, outside Endoscopy, near the South Block entrance (off Redlands Road) and in West Drive.</p>
 
                <p>Disabled badge holders must not park on yellow lines anywhere on site, please read the disabled drivers handbook for more information.</p>

                <p>Wheelchairs may be found in the multi-storey car park or ask at Main Reception.</p>
                
                <p>There is also an electric buggy driven by volunteers available to transport patients around the hospital between 9.30am and 12.00 noon and 1.30pm and 4.00pm Monday to Friday. If you require assistance between the car park and the hospital, please speak to a receptionist.</p>

                <p>Charges</p>

                <p>There are barriers to the multi storey car park, so you will need to take a ticket to enter it.  Before you return to your vehicle (at the end of your stay) please pay the amount due at a pay station (these are located on levels 0 and 2). This will validate your ticket and allow you to exit the car park.</p>

                <p>Parking charges are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up to 1 hour £1.50</li>
                    <li>Up to 2 hours £3.00</li>
                    <li>Up to 3 hours £4.50</li>
                    <li>Up to 4 hours £6.00</li>
                    <li>Up to 6 hours £9.00</li>
                    <li>All day parking £12</li>
                    <li>Maximum stay is 24 hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Currently cash only is accepted in the pay machines. Income generated from car parking charges is used for the benefit of patient care.</p>
                <p>
                    Exemptions to normal parking charges<br>
                    The following are eligible to be issued with a free parking permit on a ‘one per patient’ basis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>partners of women in labour</li>
                    <li>visitors (close relatives) to patients in SCBU, Paediatric wards</li>
                    <li>to be authorised at the discretion of the ward sister.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The issued permit will allow free or concessionary parking of one motor vehicle in any Trust public on-site pay & display space for the period quoted on the permit. Maximum permit duration is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>concessionary permits one week</li>
                    <li>free permits one month</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When their permit expires, eligible applicants can reapply for another permit. The permit will specify the car registration number and is therefore not transferable to other vehicles.
                </p>
                <p><em>Application form</em></p>
                <p>
                    To get free or concessionary parking, parents  should complete an application form (these are available in the clinic or on the ward – please ask at the ward or clinic reception desk) and get it authorised by the ward sister or departmental manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All applicants should then present their authorised application form to Security at the reception desk, level 2 Main Entrance building at the Royal Berkshire Hospital site.
