Grandparents of the baby are welcome between 2pm and 3pm and then between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. Under special circumstances other visitors may be allowed,but this would need to be discussed and agreed in advance with the Sister in charge.

                <p><strong>Number of visitors</strong><br>
                    Due to space restrictions, we ask families to limit visiting to 3 at  a cot at any one time. One of these should be a parent. Visitors can be rotated during the visiting hours.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings</strong><br>
                    Siblings are welcome to visit with their parents. It is requested that all children are closely supervised.

                    Outdoor coats should be removed on entering the Neonatal Unit and hung on the hooks provided.

                <p><strong>Family and friends</strong><br>
                    Although it is very natural for family and friends to wish to visit the Neonatal Unit, they are respectfully reminded that the babies are here because they are very small and/or sick and need to be in a quiet and controlled environment. For this reason we do not permit any visitors except parents, grandparents and the baby’s brothers and sisters.

Many parents find support by talking amongst themselves on the Unit and nursing staff are also always on hand to provide a listening ear. If any families are having particular difficulties, then staff would be happy to refer them to an appropriate source of support. This may be the PALS service, the chaplaincy or even for some practical advice on which benefits they may be entitled to and how to claim them.
                </p>

                    The trust also has a Birth Reflections Team which provides primarily a listening service, offering a one to one appointment with a midwife within a quiet setting. The aim of the service is to enable you to gain some clarity for your personal enquiry regarding your birth experience. This may include re-visiting your birth story, enabling any ‘gaps’ in care to be addressed, acknowledging your perceptions, experience and feelings and preparing for a potential future pregnancy.

                <p><strong>Breastfeeding advisor</strong><br>
                    All the staff on the Neonatal Unit are skilled in assisting mothers to successfully establish breast feeding and will teach mothers according to the principles of the Baby Friendly Initiative. This means that advice given by midwives on the labour ward/Postnatal ward and offered on the Neonatal unit should be consistent. Contact numbers for other breastfeeding support groups are also available. The lead for breastfeeding on the Neonatal unit is Sister Liz Stanton.
